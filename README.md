The purpose of this game is to be a playground for *dynamic music*. This is when the background music changes in correspondence to the environment. For example, our town has a light and airy theme. As we enter the plains, the music becomes more upbeat and adventurous. However, when we begin a combat, the music shifts again to be more dramatic. In all three cases, the theme is the same, but instruments can seamlessly enter in and out to make the music feel immersive and seamless.

## How do we do it?
